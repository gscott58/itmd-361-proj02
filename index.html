          <p>I have earned professional Web Design and Web Application Development graduate certificates from Chicago's <strong>DePaul University</strong> and <strong>Illinois Institute of Technology</strong>.&nbsp  I have deep understanding of how the <I>world-wide-web</i> works, and I know a lot about Information Technology.&nbsp  The <i>world-wide-web</i>, is an interconnected network of networks, whereby, hypertext documents, applications and their related databases, electronic mail, and file sharing are accomplished using HTTP protocols.&nbsp  I bring practical experience developing, implementing and supporting networked applications and their related databases.  
          </p>
   
          <p>I have in-depth understanding of all phases of full-stack web application development.  I can work frontend (i.e. client-side) or server side.  I have full understanding of DevOpps principles and Agile Methodology (Scrum). As a frontend web developer, I can apply UI/UX design principles and best practices utilizing: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, consume JSON Restful APIs, and utilize frontend libraries like jQuery and Bootstrap.  I have deep understanding of frontend Vue.Js framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications (coupled with PHP and Laravel).
          </p>
   
          <p>As a backend web application developer, I understand and can work with server-side LAMP stack (Linux, Apache HTTP Server, MYSQL, PHP) or MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express HTTP Server, Nodejs) with PUG templating.  I understand how WordPress architecture works.  Meaning, I can modify and enhance WP themes and provide WP website support. I have more than 25 years practical IT experience, encompassing network and mainframe platforms. With more than 15 years coding, working with, and managing professional contract DBAs and developers.
          </p>
   
          <p>November 2016, I completed DePaul University's Web Development with JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery Certificate Program.  DePaul's program focused primarily on frontend web development serving static pages.  May 2018, I completed Illinois Institute of Technology's Professional Certificate Web Design and Web Application Development program. IIT's program focused on full-stack web application development; including design (UI/UX) and handicap accessibility. In contrast, IIT's program focused on all three elements of the web stack:

          <ol>           
              <li>Web Design and Human Computer Interactions</li>
              <li>Frontend Web Development</li>
              <li>Backend Web Application Development</li>
              <li>Database Manipulation (serving dynamic pages)</li>
          </ol>
          </p>
   
          <p>To your team, I bring great understanding and knowledge of relational database application development with real life practical experience collaborating cross-departmentally with Computer Operations to implement them.  All this, plus providing live application production support.  I bring a willingness to learn.  My professional skill set, provides a strong Information Technology foundation, enabling me to quickly learn new technology (on the fly).
